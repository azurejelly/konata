    /// I've been having a lot of (frustrating) fun using grids for layouts and eventually I ended up with an edited version of this layout for my new index page! I think it looks nice and clean and I hope you have fun with it ! Only downside is it looks weird on firefox unless you zoom out, my bad. You can probably fix that with editing the code a bit, but I don't want to so B-)
